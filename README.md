# cbioportal_scripts
Tools for automating data extraction, filtering, and analysis of cancer datasets from cBioPortal.
This repository contains Python scripts developed during my work as a Bioinformatician, focused on integrating cancer mutation data from cBioPortal with external Protein‚ÄìProtein Interaction (PPI) datasets, including the Pioneer PPI dataset.

üîç Overview
The scripts in this repository support data extraction, preprocessing, and downstream analysis of cancer genomics datasets accessed through cBioPortal. They are designed to automate tasks such as:

Querying clinical and genomic data from the cBioPortal Datasets
Filtering and integrating molecular profiles
Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA)

üß¨ Use Case
These scripts were developed during my role as a Bioinformatician, where I worked on analyzing cancer-related data using resources like cBioPortal to identify genomic alterations, patient-level statistics, and potential biomarkers.
