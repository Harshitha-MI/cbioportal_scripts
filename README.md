# cbioportal_scripts
Tools for automating data extraction, filtering, and analysis of cancer datasets from cBioPortal.
This repository contains Python scripts developed during my work as a Bioinformatician, focused on integrating cancer mutation data from cBioPortal with external Protein‚ÄìProtein Interaction (PPI) datasets, including the Pioneer PPI dataset.

üîç Overview
The scripts in this repository support data extraction, preprocessing, and downstream analysis of cancer genomics datasets accessed through cBioPortal. They are designed to automate tasks such as:

Querying clinical and genomic data from the cBioPortal Datasets
Filtering and integrating molecular profiles
Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Integrating the Pioneer PPI dataset with mutation data
Mapping UniProt accession numbers to gene names for downstream annotation

These scripts support downstream analysis aimed at identifying biologically meaningful interactions and mutation-driven disruptions in cancer.
